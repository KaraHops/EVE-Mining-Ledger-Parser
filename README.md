# EVE-Mining-Ledger-Parser
A parsing tool for the EVE Online mining ledger to calculate refined outputs on a per-character basis.

The majority of the features of this tool can be used in Github Pages, here: https://karahops.github.io/EVE-Mining-Ledger-Parser/

In order to make use of the evepraisal integration, it is necessary to deploy your own copy of the code on a webserver running PHP. 

This tool supports pasting from:
- Refinery moon mining ledgers
- Fleet loot history

If this project saved you some time and you'd like to say thanks, send isk to the ingame character Kara Hops. :)
